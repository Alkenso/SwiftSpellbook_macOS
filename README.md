## Motivation
While participating in many macOS projects I use the same tools and standard types extensions.
Once I've decided stop to copy-paste code from project to project and make single library that covers lots of developer needs in utility code.

## Aggregate package
Now this package aggregates previously-independent packages for macOS:
- Mac: Swift wrappers around POSIX and other low-level C API for macOS
- MacShims: (useful C libraries without native Swift module)
- EndpointSecurity: Swift wrapper around EndpointSecurity framework
- XPC: XPC powered by Swift type system
- Launchctl: Swift API that mirrors `launchctl` utility
- HDIUtil: Swift API that mirrors `hdiutil` utility
